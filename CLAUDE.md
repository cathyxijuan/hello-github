### Key Files

- **README.md** (`/home/user/hello-github/README.md:1`): Main project documentation containing basic project information
- **second try.Rproj** (`/home/user/hello-github/second try.Rproj:1`): R Studio project settings and configuration
- **.gitignore** (`/home/user/hello-github/.gitignore:1`): Excludes R temporary files (.Rproj.user, .Rhistory, .RData)

---

## Technology Stack

### Primary Technologies
- **R**: Statistical computing and graphics language
- **R Studio**: Integrated development environment for R
- **Git**: Version control system

### Development Environment
- **Encoding:** UTF-8
- **Workspace Management:** Default restore/save behavior
- **Code Indexing:** Enabled

---

## Code Standards and Conventions

### Formatting Rules
Based on the R Studio project configuration (`second try.Rproj:8-9`):

- **Indentation:** Use spaces, NOT tabs
- **Indent Size:** 2 spaces per indentation level
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 for all text files
- **Line Endings:** Follow R Studio defaults

### R-Specific Conventions
- **Weave Engine:** Sweave for R Markdown documents
- **LaTeX Engine:** pdfLaTeX for PDF generation
- **Workspace:** Default restore and save settings enabled
- **History:** Always save R command history

---

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
This project uses Claude-specific branch naming:
- **Format:** `claude/claude-md-milhg90t2qo2mlec-01SiNCvA7gMWoyNZyhcSL75S`
- **Pattern:** `claude/<descriptive-name>-<session-id>`
- **Current Branch:** `claude/claude-md-milhg90t2qo2mlec-01SiNCvA7gMWoyNZyhcSL75S`

### Commit History
Recent commits (from newest to oldest):
1. `ec5fb4e` - first commit
2. `acb4c02` - try to commit
3. `ff43613` - README.md

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Keep messages concise and descriptive
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference what changed, not how it changed
- Examples from this repo: "first commit", "README.md"

### Git Push Requirements
**CRITICAL:** When pushing changes:
- Always use: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
- Branch MUST start with 'claude/' and end with matching session ID
- Retry up to 4 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) on network errors
- 403 errors indicate branch name mismatch - verify branch name format

### Git Fetch/Pull Requirements
- Prefer specific branch fetches: `git fetch origin <branch-name>`
- Retry up to 4 times with exponential backoff on network failures
- Use: `git pull origin <branch-name>`

## Development Workflow

### For AI Assistants

1. **Before Making Changes:**
   - Always read existing files before modifying them
   - Check current git status: `git status`
   - Verify you're on the correct branch
   - Review recent commits to understand context

2. **Making Changes:**
   - Follow the 2-space indentation convention
   - Maintain UTF-8 encoding for all files
   - Keep changes focused and minimal
   - Don't over-engineer solutions

3. **Committing Changes:**
   - Stage relevant files: `git add <files>`
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Use heredoc format for multi-line messages
   - Verify commit success with `git status`

4. **Pushing Changes:**
   - Ensure you're on the correct claude/* branch
   - Use: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
   - Implement retry logic for network failures
   - Never force push without explicit permission

---

## File Ignore Patterns

The `.gitignore` excludes:
- `.Rproj.user` - R Studio user-specific files
- `.Rhistory` - R command history
- `.RData` - R workspace data

**Important:** These files are regenerated by R Studio and should never be committed.

---

## R Studio Project Settings

```
Version: 1.0
RestoreWorkspace: Default
SaveWorkspace: Default
AlwaysSaveHistory: Default
EnableCodeIndexing: Yes
UseSpacesForTab: Yes
NumSpacesForTab: 2
Encoding: UTF-8
RnwWeave: Sweave

```

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### What to Do ✅
- Read all relevant files before making suggestions
- Follow the 2-space indentation standard
- Maintain UTF-8 encoding
- Keep solutions simple and focused
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- Use the TodoWrite tool for multi-step tasks
- Commit with descriptive messages
- Push to the correct claude/* branch

### What NOT to Do ❌
- Don't modify `.gitignore` without user request
- Don't create unnecessary files
- Don't add features beyond what's requested
- Don't push to branches other than assigned claude/* branch
- Don't commit R Studio temporary files (.Rproj.user, .Rhistory, .RData)
- Don't use tabs for indentation (use 2 spaces)
- Don't skip reading files before editing them
- Don't force push without explicit permission

### Security Considerations
- No secrets or credentials should be committed
- Review `.gitignore` before committing new file types
- Warn user if they request committing sensitive files
- Don't expose private data in commit messages

## Common Tasks

### Creating New R Files
```r
# Use 2-space indentation
# UTF-8 encoding
# Follow R style guide conventions
```

### Running R Code
```bash
# In R Studio or R console
Rscript your_script.R
```

### Checking Project Status
```bash
git status                    # Check working tree status
git log --oneline -10        # View recent commits
git branch                   # List branches
```
